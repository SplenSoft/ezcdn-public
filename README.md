## Description

An addressables-free suite that automatically handles the Unity Cloud Content Delivery API and packaging/deploying assetbundles while providing several tools to make asset management easy.

## Getting Started

You can [download the package on the Unity Asset Store](https://u3d.as/3eTj).

Here's a video tutorial: 

### Installation and Setup
* [Create a Unity ID account](https://id.unity.com/) (if you donâ€™t already have one)
* [Enable Unity Services in your project](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SettingUpProjectServices.html), if you haven't already
* [Get the package from the Unity Asset Store](https://u3d.as/3eTj) and install it into your project. If you need help with this, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackagesPurchase.html)
* If you've installed the package correctly, there will be a new Menu at the top of the screen called SplenSoft, if it wasn't there already
* Using that menu, navigate to SplenSoft -> AssetBundles -> Settings
