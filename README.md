## Description

A full-service suite that automatically handles the Unity Cloud Content Delivery API and packaging/deploying assetbundles while providing several tools to make asset management easy.

## Getting Started

You can download the package on the Unity Asset Store.

Here's a video tutorial: 

### Installation and Setup
* [Enable Unity Services in your project](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SettingUpProjectServices.html), if you haven't already
* Get the package from the Unity Asset Store and install it into your project. If you need help with this, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackagesPurchase.html)
* If you've installed the package correctly, there will be a new Menu at the top of the screen called SplenSoft, if it wasn't there already.
* Using that menu, Navigate to SplenSoft -> AssetBundles -> Settings
